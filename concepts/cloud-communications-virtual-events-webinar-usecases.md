# Virtual events webinar overview
Microsoft Graph virtual events webinar APIs allows you to get Teams webinar data and programmatically create, update and delete a Teams webinar.

To make the best use of the Graph virtual events webinar APIs, it’s helpful to understand the personas for the users who access the Teams webinar experience: 

- **Organizers** are employees (in your organization) who manage the webinar. They are the authority on schedule and participants. They configure webinar attributes such as title, theme, attendee experience, and email rules.   
- **Presenters** are employees (in your organization) or external participants who lead the webinar.   
- **Registrants** are users (in or outside of your organization) who have registered for a webinar. They can be registered, waitlisted, or rejected. They can choose to cancel their webinar registration.   
- **Attendees** are registrants who join the webinar. They need to have registered through a portal and answered registration questions. 
- **Teams tenant administrator** must authorize custom applications with appropriate permissions.
