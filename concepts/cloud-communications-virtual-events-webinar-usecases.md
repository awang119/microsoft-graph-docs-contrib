# Virtual events webinar API overview
Microsoft Graph virtual events webinar APIs allows you to get Teams webinar data and programmatically create, update and delete a Teams webinar.

To make the best use of the Graph virtual events webinar APIs, it’s helpful to understand the personas for the users who access the Teams webinar experience: 

- **Organizers** are employees (in your organization) who manage the webinar. They are the authority on schedule and participants. They configure webinar attributes such as title, theme, attendee experience, and email rules.   
- **Presenters** are employees (in your organization) or external participants who lead the webinar.   
- **Registrants** are users (in or outside of your organization) who have registered for a webinar. They can be registered, waitlisted, or rejected. They can choose to cancel their webinar registration.   
- **Attendees** are registrants who join the webinar. They need to have registered through a portal and answered registration questions. 
- **Teams tenant administrator** must authorize custom applications with appropriate permissions.

**[INSERT TABLE OF DIFF PERSONAS AND PERMISSIONS]**

The following resource types can be used to build your webinar solution 
- [virtualEventWebinar](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventwebinar.md) – Used to create, get, update, publish, cancel, and list Teams webinars.  
- [virtualEventRegistration](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventregistration.md) – Used to create, get, cancel, and list registration records of registrants of a webinar. Provides the unique Teams webinar join URL for the registered registrant. 
- [virtualEventRegistrationQuestion](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventregistrationquestionbase.md) – Used to create, list, and delete either custom registration questions or predefined registration questions for registrants to answer when they register for a webinar.  
- [virtualEventRegistrationConfiguration](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventregistrationconfiguration.md) – Contains information about a webinar registration configuration that stores the registration portal URL of the webinar.  
- [virtualEventPresenter](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventpresenter.md) – Used to create, get, list, update and delete a presenter for a Teams webinar. 
- [virtualEventSession](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/virtualeventsession.md)  – A webinar created via Microsoft Graph APIs only has one session that inherits the properties of online meetings. 
- [meetingAttendanceReport](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/meetingattendancereport.md) – Each time a webinar ends, an attendance report is generated for the session but doesn’t include attendee data.   
- [attendanceRecord](../api-reference/v1.0/resources/attendancerecord.md) – Provides webinar attendee data in the attendance report.  
- [virtual event webhooks](/concepts/changenotifications-for-virtualevent.md) – Can receive notifications for changes to a webinar, webinar registration, session, attendance report, and so on.
